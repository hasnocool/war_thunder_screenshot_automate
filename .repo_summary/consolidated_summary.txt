Here's a summary of my project:

**1. Project Name:** War_Thunder_Screenshot_Automate
**2. Short Description:** A Python script that automates screenshot capturing in the game War Thunder using image recognition and machine learning algorithms.
**3. Overall Description:** I built this project to simplify the process of taking high-quality screenshots in War Thunder, a popular online multiplayer game. The script uses OpenCV and Scikit-Image to detect specific game elements on screen, automatically adjusting its capture settings for optimal results. This is particularly useful for gamers who want to showcase their victories or defeats without having to manually take and edit screenshots.
**4. Main Purpose:** My main purpose with this project was to experiment with computer vision techniques in a real-world gaming scenario. I wanted to see how well image recognition algorithms could be applied to automate tasks within a game, and whether it would yield improved results compared to manual screenshot taking.
**5. Key Technologies:**
	- Python 3.x
	- OpenCV 4.x for image processing and computer vision
	- Scikit-Image for image analysis and feature extraction
	* I'm thinking about adding support for other game clients or platforms in the future, but that will depend on the demand.
**6. Unique Features:**
	- Automated screenshot capturing based on game element detection
	- Customizable capture settings for optimal results
	- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface (CLI)
**7. Future Improvements:**
	- Expanding support to other games or platforms
	- Enhancing the script's accuracy using more advanced machine learning techniques
	- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier configuration and use
**8. Personal Notes:** I'm really proud of how this project turned out, and I believe it showcases my ability to apply computer vision concepts in creative ways. One cool feature is that the script can even detect specific game events, like battles or victories, and automatically save a screenshot when they occur.
