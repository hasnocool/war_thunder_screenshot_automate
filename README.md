**War Thunder Screenshot Automate**
=====================================

I'm super excited to share my latest project: **War_Thunder_Screenshot_Automate**! This tool is designed to automate the process of taking screenshots in War Thunder, a popular online multiplayer game.

**Description**
---------------

As an avid gamer and developer, I built this project to streamline my gameplay experience. Tired of manually taking screenshots or missing out on crucial moments, I created an automated system that takes care of capturing the perfect shot every time!

**Features**
------------

One cool feature is... **Auto-Screenshot**: simply set up the game window, configure your preferences, and let the tool do the rest! The script will automatically take a screenshot at specified intervals or when specific events occur (e.g., plane destruction).

Other features include:

*   **Customizable interval**: choose how often you'd like to capture screenshots
*   **Event-based triggering**: take screenshots when planes are destroyed, tanks get hit, or other game-specific events occur
*   **Game window detection**: the tool can automatically detect and position itself on top of your War Thunder game window
